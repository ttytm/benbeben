# Bento

_Bento is a young project that aims to present
Insights into performance-related data in an accessible way._

![Preview](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e1ed9a3-c2f6-411f-9049-ca7352f68186)

It is planned to extend the repository with source code over time.
Until the project moves beyond its initial experimental stage
it is expected that working in a closed environment will reduce
organizational effort and enable faster development.

In the meantime, this repository will help to assess whether there is public
interest and serve as a communication channel to the broader "open" world.
If you'd like to request an enhancement or report a bug, please use the GitHub issue tracker.
